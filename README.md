Like Raycast but running in the terminal. The goal of this project is to create a `termcast` command that can run all Raycast extensions as terminal user interfaces

Differences with Raycast

- Uses Bun instead of Node
- Renders in a terminal instead of a custom MacOS App

## Why

Raycast is a wonderful idea and it helps doing things faster. But do we really need an additional app to do these things?

What if Raycast was just a simple shortcut to display the terminal in the center of the screen and run a `termcast` command?

This project will finally enabled some features I have been waiting for Raycast to add for a long time:

- Support for running extensions in background
- Support for Linux and Windows
- Run extensions in remote servers
- Let LLMs control extensions
- Use native binaries and bindings in extensions
- Distribute extensions without adding them to the Raycast store
- Turn any Raycast extension into an independent executable users can install without knowing what Raycast is
